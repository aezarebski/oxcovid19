The [OxCOVID19 Project](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) aims to increase
our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and elaborate possible
strategies to reduce the impact on the society through the combined
power of statistical, mathematical modelling, and machine learning
techniques. The [OxCOVID19 Database](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) is a
large, single-centre, multimodal relational database consisting of
information (using acknowledged sources) related to COVID-19 pandemic.
This package provides an R-specific interface to the [OxCOVID19
Database](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) based on widely-used data
handling and manipulation approaches in R.
